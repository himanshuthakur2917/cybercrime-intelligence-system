The caller, who called himself Vikram Singh, said he was from Golden Wealth Management and promised 15% weekly returns. He sounded very professional and even sent me fake registration documents. I made an initial investment of Rs 50,000 and within 3 days, my online dashboard showed Rs 1,50,000. This convinced me to invest more. Over the next few weeks, I transferred a total of Rs 18,47,500 in multiple transactions. When I tried to withdraw on 8th January, the website showed 'under maintenance'. All WhatsApp numbers were blocked and the website disappeared."
