## The Prompt

**Objective**: Create a 12-slide presentation for law enforcement stakeholders (Police Commissioners, DGP, Ministry officials) about the "Cybercrime Intelligence System (CIS)". The tone should be authoritative, professional, and impact-driven.

**Theme**: Modern Police Tech, Dark Mode, Sleek, Professional.

**Slide-by-Slide Structure**:

1.  **Title Slide**: Cybercrime Intelligence System (CIS): Revolutionizing Digital Investigations. Include a subtitle: "Graph-Powered Intelligence for a Safer Digital India."
2.  **The Problem**: Fragmented Data & Silent Criminals. Discuss how siloed CDR, banking, and police records (FIRs) allow cyber-criminal rings to thrive undetected.
3.  **The Solution**: CIS Overview. A centralized hub that merges multi-source data into a single, interactive intelligence ecosystem.
4.  **Architecture Stack**: Built on the "Gold Standard" of Tech: 
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js
    *   **Backend**: NestJS
    *   *Graph Core*: Neo4j
    *   **Database**: Supabase (Postgres)
5.  **Technical Deep Dive**: Relationship Mapping. How Neo4j turns millions of rows of CSV data into a connected graph of human relationships.
6.  **Feature 1: Interactive Network Visualization**: Visualizing "Rings" and "Kingpins" using D3.js. Seeing the unseen connections.
7.  **Feature 2: Advanced Geolocation & Trajectory**: Using CDR data for cell tower triangulation and movement path analysis of suspects.
8.  **Feature 3: Production Case Management**: End-to-end FIR tracking, evidence management, and investigation logging.
9.  **Feature 4: Team & Officer Management**: Admin-level control over investigator roles (RBAC), assignments, and audit logs.
10. **Data Flow**: From raw data (NCRP, CCTNS, CDR) to automated intelligence.
11. **Real-World Impact**: Reducing investigation timelines from weeks to hours and increasing conviction rates with high-fidelity relationship evidence.
12. **Future Scope & Scalability**: AI-generated case briefings (Google Gemini), predictive crime hotspots, and state-wide elastic deployment.

**Key Visuals to Include**: Use professional stock photos or AI-generated images of:
*   Digital network maps/graphs.
*   Police officers using high-tech dashboards.
*   Abstract data flow diagrams.
*   Modern, sleek icons for Next.js, Neo4j, and Supabase.
